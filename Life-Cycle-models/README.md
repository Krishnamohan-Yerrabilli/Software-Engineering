### To design efficient software we need to follow a specific model by going through, it leads to better results
  
- It's a Sequence of decisions that you make, going to 
- be a part of the history of your project
- that you are going to be built
- and eventually used by the people
  
## Process model

It means what do I do next?
How long shall I do it?

- There are many ways in which you can make these decisions

- If the project is small, if it's only needed between 
- 3 to 10 people then agile is a good choice here.

- Criticality of software plays an important role when choosing a model

- If the project is big, like building an Air traffic controlling 
- operating system, word processor, or 
- distributed system then agile is maybe not a good choice for you
  
- In some cases, there are situations where you need to use 
- waterfall model for some part and agile for another part

- Choosing the right model is the fundamental to any software design
