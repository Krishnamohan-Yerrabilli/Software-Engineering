## Implementation

- Here we take the design of the system </br>
  and creating an actual software system </br>
  

## 4 principles can affect the way software systems constructed

### Reduction of complexity

- This Aims to decrease the complexity, built to be easy to </br> understand and use
	
### Anticipation of Diversity

- When we implement the code we want to be conscious in 	 all</br>
  ways, this code is built by taking into consideration of</br>
  future changes of tech.

### Structuring of validation

- We want to make sure, it's easy to testable, during</br>
  verification and validation

### Use of standards

- It's important for software when we want to take internal</br> standards of an organization or external organizations

- examples: Internal organization (Coding standards) or</br> (Naming standards)
