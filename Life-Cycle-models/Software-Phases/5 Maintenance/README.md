## Maintenance

- After the organization successfully developed  </br>
  the application will release </br>
  to the final users.

- Maintenance is all about sustained as it evolves </br>
  throughout the life cycle of the application
  
- While software in the operation(running in production)</br>
  many things can happen

## 3 Common problems that maintenance  

### Environment change

- Here Environment means OS sustainable with new version </br> 
  changes

### Feature Request

- Users want to do something new in our application</br>
  requesting a new feature
  
### bug report

- Users might find out problems with the software</br>
  there are some situations where the app will crash</br>
  
- When this type of scenario occurs this bug</br>
  reports sends back to the developer then the dev </br>
  modify the code as per customer needs</br>
  After successful development make sure 

### Organisations perform 3 kinds of activities.

### Corrective maintainence

-  Eliminate problems with the code

### Perfective maintenance

- To support feature request problems, to improve the software</br>

### Adaptive maintainence

- To take care of environmental changes

After these activities have been done a new version of the software</br>
has been released

## (Regression Testing)

- During maintenance every time you modify the code</br>
  and it must be re-test to make sure it's not produced </br>
  unexpected errors in the future and the evalute the  </br> 
  defined changes work as expected</br>
