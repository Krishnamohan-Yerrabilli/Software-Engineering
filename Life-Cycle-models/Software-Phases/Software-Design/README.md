## Software Design

- This is where software requirements are analyzed In </br>
  order to produce the internal structure of the system </br>
  
- This description of the system, serves as the basis of the
  system

## Traditionally this phase consists of some design activities

- Architectural design phase

- Abstract Specification

- Interface Design

- Component Design

- Data structure

- Algorithm Design

## The core idea here is, We went from

- High-level view of the system (Architectural design phase) <---------> LOW-level view of the system (Algorithm Design phase)
