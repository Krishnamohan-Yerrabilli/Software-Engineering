### Cost of Correcting an Error

- This depends on the number of sub-sequent decisions you made

- it changes the decision making process crusial because of the low cost

- if you find errors in this phase, it decrease the overall cost of sp

## (Steps to Implement) Requirements engineering


### Elicitation
 
- collections of requirments from the stakeholders and other sources

### Requirements Analysis

- Which involves a study and a deeper understanding of the collected requirments

### Specification

- Here we collectively organize and save the requirmentnes for represetation and share

### Validation

- In this phase we make sure the document is complete, consistent, and reduandant </br> 
  free, satisfy a set of important properties and many more...

### Requirements Management

- Which accounts changes to requirements during lifetime of the project.
